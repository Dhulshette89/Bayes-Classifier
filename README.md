# Bayes-Classifier
Description of Problem -  implement a Minimum Risk Bayes Decision Theoretic classifier 
			    and use it to classify the test examples in the provided datasets. Calculate accuracy.

• Description of your Solution -
Data is classified and accuracy is measured , as per the observation the accuracy for the corrupted iris dataset 
is always little less than the accuracy for the iris dataset.

Output is as follows:

Accuracy for the iris Dataset:
Average Accuarcy =0.806667 ( may vary little as you shuffle the dataset)

Accuracy for the iris Dataset:
Average Accuarcy =0.726667 ( may vary little as you shuffle the dataset)
 

• Assumptions-
All conditional density functions are multivariate Gaussian 
Each class has its own covariance matrix 
Equally likely prior probabilities 
0-1 loss function 
10-fold cross validation for training & testing
